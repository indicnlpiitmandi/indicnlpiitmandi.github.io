Welcome to our Special Session on "Consciousness and LLMs: A Synergistic Approach to Intelligence", organized by  IIT Mandi(<a href="https://iksmha.iitmandi.ac.in/mbcc/2025/"><b>MBCC</b></a>) and BharatGen.

The integration of consciousness studies and Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of intelligence. This special session serves as a platform to bridge cutting-edge advancements in AI with the mysteries of human cognition, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers, technologists, and philosophers.

This session will cover a range of topics, including:

+ Examining curiosity as a fundamental aspect of conscious awareness and its impact on intelligence and learning in LLM's. 
+ Investigating how intuitive decisions, emotional understanding, and cultural connections influence the development of conscious-like behaviors in LLM systems. 
+ Modeling curiosity-driven problem-solving in AI to enable systems that emulate human-like curiosity and adaptability.
+ Exploring novel methodologies to integrate consciousness concepts into AI, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and attention mechanisms inspired by cognitive neuroscience. 
+ Using LLMs and neural-symbolic approaches to model self-awareness, reflection, and meta-cognition. 
+ Leveraging AI tools to simulate and analyze states of consciousness, enabling interdisciplinary studies at the interface of neuroscience, philosophy, and AI.
+ Highlighting the limitations of current AI models in capturing the depth of human cultural, emotional, and cognitive diversity. 
+ Proposing innovative frameworks to enable LLMs to better model nuanced emotional states, cross-cultural perspectives, and symbolic reasoning tied to consciousness. 
+ Incorporating consciousness-aware feedback mechanisms to enhance the authenticity of human-AI interactions.
+ Examining how LLMs and NLP tools are reshaping our understanding of intelligence and consciousness in humans and machines. 
+ Envisioning the role of generative AI in advancing studies on self-awareness, meta-awareness, and cognitive processes. 
+ Investigating how AI systems can evolve beyond static reasoning models to embrace dynamic, consciousness-inspired frameworks for problem-solving and adaptation.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts and full papers on the themes of this session and look forward to engaging with a vibrant community of scholars and innovators at MBCC 2025. Together, let us redefine the boundaries of intelligence and consciousness!
