title: Consciousness and LLMs - A Synergistic Approach to Intelligence
description: C-LLMS @ MBCC 2025, June 4-7, 2025
---

Welcome to our **Special Session on Consciousness and LLMs**!


Welcome to our Special Session on "Consciousness and LLMs: A Synergistic Approach to Intelligence"!

The integration of consciousness studies and Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of intelligence. This special session serves as a platform to bridge cutting-edge advancements in AI with the mysteries of human cognition, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers, technologists, and philosophers.

This session will cover a range of topics, including:

+ The role of curiosity in intelligence: How intuitive decisions, emotional understanding, and cultural connections shape consciousness and drive transformative innovation.
+ Advancing AI tools for consciousness studies: Exploring methodologies and techniques to integrate concepts of consciousness into AI development, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF).
+ Ethical challenges in AI development: Addressing the complexities of aligning AI systems with human values, including issues related to bias, transparency, and accountability.
+ Bridging ancient wisdom with modern technologies: Connecting philosophical insights and cognitive practices with contemporary advancements in AI to foster cognitive wellness.
+ Cultural and emotional nuances in LLMs: Understanding the limitations of current models and proposing frameworks to capture deeper human-like cognition.
+ The future of intelligence studies in the era of Generative AI: Examining how LLMs and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools are reshaping our approaches to intelligence research.
+ Post-session, we aim to publish a white paper summarizing the key discussions and insights (with participant permissions). Additionally, we plan to create a community platform on Discord (or a similar space) to facilitate ongoing collaboration and knowledge-sharing among researchers and practitioners.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts and full papers on the themes of this session and look forward to engaging with a vibrant community of scholars and innovators at MBCC 2025. Together, let us redefine the boundaries of intelligence and consciousness!
